Pycraft
=======

A console based 2D Minecraft, runs best on Unix. Built by [grit96](//github.com/grit96) and [olls](//github.com/olls).

This is the Nunchuk branch, a very experimental/hacky version in which the game can be controled via a Wii Nunchuck connected to the computer via an arduino. Not recommended to use this version.
